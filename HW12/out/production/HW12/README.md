# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming HW12
# Author: Gor Hayrapetyan

## Overview
This repository features a diverse collection of programming solutions implemented in C++ and Java. It includes practical applications and demonstrations of data structure manipulation, object-oriented programming, and efficient algorithm implementations. The projects range from dynamic message composition using a deque data structure, score aggregation using hash sets, geometric calculations of polygon perimeters, to complex operations on polynomial expressions using class overloads in C++. Each program is designed to tackle specific computational challenges, offering efficient and effective solutions.

## Problems
1. **Message Tube**: Manipulates messages using a transparent tube model with operations to add and remove letter cards dynamically.
2. **Trivia Game Scoring**: Computes total scores for participants in a trivia game, demonstrating the use of custom classes and hash sets in Java.
3. **Polygon Perimeter Calculator**: Calculates the perimeter of a polygon given the coordinates of its vertices, showcasing geometric computation in C++.
4. **Polynomial Operations**: Implements a robust Polynomial class in C++ that supports basic arithmetic operations, capable of evaluating and manipulating polynomial expressions.
